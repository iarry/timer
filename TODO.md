## Timer page

-   [ ] Add a `next` button, that uses the same icon as `reset`, but flip it
        horizontally. It should skip to the next exercise or rest segment. Take
        note to update the total time like it does when we go back. We can move
        the mute button to the top right of the screen - use the same spacing
        from the window edge as the `X` to close the page.
-   [ ] Make the ring always stay centered on the page - this only an issue when
        the the exercise name wraps to two lines, and then it bumps the
        alignment.
-   [ ] During the rest phase, show a "Next: <exercise name>" below rest.
